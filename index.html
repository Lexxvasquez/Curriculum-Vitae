            My name is Alexis Vasquez but I go by Lexx. I live in the Sunshine
            State. I love to spend my days off with my German Shepherd and my
            Bichon Frise. They're full of energy and love to make a mess in the
            house with toys everywhere! Spending time with family is very
            important to me. We love to do family dinners on Sundays and talk
            about life! We're all working towards the goal to better our lives
            financially. One thing I love about my family is we're very goal
            oriented.
          </p>

            Another, good fact about me is I graduated from Nature Coast Tech
            High school located in Brooksville. After High School I attened
            Pasco Hernando State College where I was studying for Forensic
            Science. I unfortunately had a change in career and started to study
            about Real Estate. I attened the course and passed where I got my
            Florida License to sell homes! It has truly been an amazing 6 years
            helping so many people find their forever homes and sell their
            Florida homes. In the process of all of this you meet amazing people
            from all around the world and you build relationships that you never
            could've imagined. My goal now is to learn everything in this Coding
            Bootcamp. So, I can have a successful career in Front End
            Development.
